# React test assignment - contact list

Test assignments are common way how to test skills of potential candidates.

But they are very good to sharpen your programming skills, too. You take extra care about the code, comments and description and that teaches you in good habits. After all this is what you want eventually - to write nice, self-described, readable and maintainable code.

It teaches you one more very important skill - effectivity. You don't have unlimited period of time (even you do not have deadlines). You have to deliver and you have to report time spent. Therefore your ability to prioritize, to make progressive enhancements (due maintainable code) and be reasonable about the time is very important and valuable skill.

Let's judge (and hopefully learn from) one of my assignment I've done. It's not perfect.

Please comment, criticize or ask (in the issues). This is part of the learning process (and learning never ends).

## What next?

Depending on my time I plan to make RxJS version of this assignment. Because I believe that the different thinking it requires is good to expand my skills.

Maybe I add things from TODO list or Nice to have (see [solution](./SOLUTION.md)).

We will see :)
